Task Management Web Application

A web application demonstrating the use of a NoSQL database (MongoDB) with document-oriented storage and a full set of CRUD operations. This project manages users and their profiles, and demonstrates frontend-backend integration.


Features

- User registration and login
- User profile page
- Adding, editing, and deleting users
- Integration with the MongoDB database
- Separation of frontend and backend
- Client-server interaction using a REST API


Technologies

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB


Project Structure

The project is divided into backend and frontend parts. Here is a description of the main folders and files:


Backend

server.js – the main server file that runs the application.

package.json and package-lock.json – store project dependencies and their exact versions.

.env – environment variables, including the MongoDB connection URI.

config/db.js – handles the connection to the MongoDB database.

controllers/ – contains the request processing logic:

  -authController.js – handles user authentication and CRUD operations.

  -projectController.js – handles project-related operations.

  -taskController.js – handles tasks within projects.

middleware/auth.js – authentication middleware for securing specific routes.

models/ – defines the data structure for MongoDB collections:

  -User.js – defines the user schema.

  -Project.js – defines the project schema.

  -Task.js – defines the task schema.

routes/ – defines API endpoints:

  -authRoutes.js – routes for authentication and user interactions.

  -projectRoutes.js – routes for projects.

  -taskRoutes.js – routes for tasks.


Frontend

index.html – Displays a list of users.

add-user.html – Form for adding a new user.

edit-user.html – Form for editing an existing user.

profile.html – Displays the profile of an authorized user.

login.html – Login page for users.

users.html – Optional page with a list of users.

style.css – Contains all styles for the frontend pages.

script.js – Contains JavaScript code for the frontend logic (data requests, DOM manipulation).

Other Files

.gitignore – Specifies which files should not be uploaded to GitHub.

README.md – Project documentation explaining setup, features, and usage.


Database Schema

Collection: 'users'  

Document structure:

json
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "name": "String",
  "email": "String",
  "password": "String"
}

_id – a unique identifier generated by MongoDB

name – username

email – user email address

password – user password (stored in this project in cleartext; hashing can be added)

Other collections (for advanced project management):

projects – contains project information

tasks – contains tasks associated with projects


MongoDB Query Examples

Adding a user:

db.users.insertOne({ name: "Dauren", email: "ewely@gmail.com", password: "121212" });

Getting all users:

db.users.find().pretty();

Updating a user:

db.users.updateOne({ _id: ObjectId("...") }, { $set: { name: "Dauren" } });

Deleting a user:

db.users.deleteOne({ _id: ObjectId("...") });

Indexing email addresses for faster searching:

db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 }, { unique: true });


API Documentation

Add a new user:
POST /api/auth/add
Use this route to create a new user.

Get all users:
GET /api/auth
Gets a list of all registered users.

Edit a user by ID:
PUT /api/auth/:id
Update a specific user's details.

Delete a user by ID:
DELETE /api/auth/:id
Deletes a user from the database.

Log in a user:
POST /api/auth/login
Route for user authentication.

Project Management:
GET /api/projects – get all projects
POST /api/projects – add a new project

Task Management:
GET /api/tasks – view all tasks
POST /api/tasks – create a new task
PUT /api/tasks/:id – edit a task by ID
DELETE /api/tasks/:id – delete a task by ID


Example fetch request for Add User:

fetch("/api/auth/add", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ name, email, password })
});
